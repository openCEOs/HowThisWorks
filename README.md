## OpenCEOs
#### A Crowd Sourced Organization

Communities are a great source of innovation. This one is for those who want to build things, those who want to work on making real world usable products, for those who want to contribute back by being mentors to fellow developers.


After planning for some time and interacting with a lot of young developers, one of the core interesting parts has been that almost everyone has so many interesting ideas which can be potential solutions. But they need two things more:
- A team to work with the support of a mentor
- Resources to make the project live!


With an aim to make each project live under this organization (we will be supporting the deployment/cloud costs). It could be a very small idea with a great potential, or something which makes life easy on a personal level.


The name is OpenCEOs because everyone who has an idea and the persistence to make it into a product is a CEO of that idea. Open represents it's open for everyone to join.


Here, we announce OpenCEOs with a few projects which are new ideas to contribute to. Some of them might be private repositories but you can definitely join the team of developers.

**We are looking out for mentors who are excited about sharing with the community and are experienced developers!**


Remember, it's open source! But remember also, once you have users, it could change tomorrow!
